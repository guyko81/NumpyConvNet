# NumpyConvNet
Convolutional Neural Network layers and training written in Numpy

The intend behind this repository is to create a convolutional neural network with some (not necessary all) of its component, all written in pure Numpy. 

It helps in understanding the basics, including convolutional forward and backward pass, maxpool and the SGD itself.
